Vibes vagrantfiles
==================

This repository has been shamelessly forked from
[joatmon08/vagrantfiles](https://github.com/joatmon08/vagrantfiles), and it
contains various configurations that we used during the Vibes project. We'll try
to polish them, but we can't guarantee anything, so you'll probabily need to
figure out how they work alone. Sorry.
